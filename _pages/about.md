Hi! I am a Computer Science Master’s student in the [Bionic Vision Lab](https://bionicvisionlab.org/) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), advised by [Prof. Michael Beyeler](https://bionicvisionlab.org/people/beyeler_michael/). I obtained my B.Eng in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (CN).

Currently, I'm working on [Robust Visual Foraging Challenge @ NeurIPS 2025](https://robustforaging.github.io/), a collaborative benchmark competition that aims to bridge biological and artificial vision through embodied AI. My main responsibility is developing the core training infrastructure: I integrate ML-Agents with Unity-based environments to create embodied reinforcement learning tasks, and package them into standalone, cross-platform executables. These environments serve as the foundation of the competition pipeline, enabling participants to train and evaluate agents under consistent, reproducible conditions.

I consider myself a “technologist” with strong software engineering skills spanning backend development, DevOps, ML pipelines, and interactive systems.
